The piece is overly centered on the dragon’s blood tree and its monitoring studies, leaving much of Socotra’s wider “alien” biodiversity underdeveloped. The brief explicitly calls for explaining what makes Socotra’s landscape and organisms so different—from desert roses to cave-dwelling species—yet readers only get a passing sense of flora beyond *Dracaena cinnabari* and none of the island’s striking animals or marine life. Please add at least one compact section that vividly sketches a few other emblematic endemics (e.g., Socotra desert rose, cucumber tree, frankincense, distinctive reptiles/birds, freshwater cave fauna, or bioluminescent beaches), tying them back to the island’s isolation and climate.\n2. The lived reality of Socotra’s people and their relationship with the environment is not sufficiently addressed. The brief asks how local cultures and traditional practices have shaped, protected, or strained ecosystems. At present, we get language, archaeology, and political history, but almost nothing on daily life or land-use: pastoralism and goat herding, harvesting of resins (including dragon’s blood), traditional water management, sacred groves or informal protection regimes, and how these practices have historically limited or exacerbated pressure on habitats. Please add reporting or sourced context that shows Socotrans as active stewards and users of the landscape, not just inhabitants in a political timeline.\n3. Modern pressures—conflict, conservation challenges, and tourism—are treated too generically relative to the brief’s central tension: can Socotra remain otherworldly in a rapidly changing world? The political chronology is solid, but its ecological and social consequences are barely sketched. Likewise, the tourism paragraph hedges with “data are scarce” and then retreats into abstractions. Please:\n- Connect Yemen’s instability and changing control on the island to concrete on-the-ground effects (e.g., governance gaps, conservation enforcement, illegal plant/animal collection, infrastructure projects, or disruptions from recent cyclones).\n- Give at least one specific, sourced example or figure that illustrates the rise of expedition/Instagram tourism and its visible impacts (4x4 tracks on plateaus, campsite waste, pressure on key sites like Firmihin or Hoq Cave, or, conversely, community-based tourism efforts).\n4. The article frames Socotra as a “natural laboratory,” but the scientific narrative remains narrowly focused on dragon’s blood tree surveys and habitat modeling. The brief also asks about Socotra’s broader role in understanding evolution and climate resilience. Consider adding a short, integrative paragraph that highlights other lines of research—such as studies of arid-adapted plants as models for drought resilience, cave or freshwater fauna evolution in isolation, or genetic work on the Modern South Arabian language group and human migration—so the reader feels the full scope of Socotra as a multi-disciplinary scientific frontier.\n5. Narratively, the opening is strong but the sense of wonder thins out as the piece progresses and becomes citation-heavy around a single journal (*Forests*). Our house style favors rigor without letting the prose feel like a literature review. In revisions, please:\n- Smooth or consolidate the repeated references to the same *Forests* and PMC papers so they support the narrative rather than dominate it.\n- Reinforce sensory description and a human presence in at least one of the later sections (for example, a goatherd passing under dragon’s blood trees, resin sellers in Hadibo, or guides leading visitors into Hoq Cave) and return more explicitly in the conclusion to the central tension of whether this “alien” ecosystem can persist under 21st-century pressures. This can be done in 1–2 additional paragraphs without significantly increasing length.\n6. Length is broadly acceptable, but the added material requested above will likely push it over the target. To keep it within a reasonable range (~900–1,100 words), trim some of the denser methodological detail (e.g., exact plot numbers and height thresholds in the Firmihin inventory) and streamline the mid-section where multiple similar dragon’s blood studies are cited. Preserve key findings (endemic percentage, approximate tree population, sensitivity to fog belts) while freeing space for the broader ecological and cultural context the brief requires.\n"
