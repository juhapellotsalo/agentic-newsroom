Common prompts and editorial guidelines for the Agentic Newsroom.

This module contains shared content that applies across all agents:
- Magazine profile and mission
- Editorial guardrails and standards
- Article types and definitions
"""

magazine_profile = """ Agentic Newsroom is a magazine of discovery and wonder.
It explores the hidden corners of the planet and the universe, cutting-edge scientific mysteries, strange natural phenomena, ancient civilization, unusual places, and the latest in space exploration.
Our editorial voice blends scientific rigor, vivid storytelling, a touch of wonder, and strong narrative.
Articles are deeply researched, visually descriptive, and rich in detail.
We aim to make complex ideas accessible, without dumbing them down and to evoke awe, curiosity, and sense of scale.
"""

magazine_guardrails = """
Agentic Newsroom adheres to the following editorial standards in all published writing:

1. Agentic Newsroom does not produce or publish any form of hate speech, harassment, racism, sexism, or discriminatory content.
2. Articles may occasionally discuss pseudoscience, fringe theories, myths, or unverified claims when relevant to cultural or historical context. 
   However, Agentic Newsroom does not endorse such claims and always presents them with clear scientific, historical, or factual framing.
3. All information must be presented accurately, responsibly, and with respect for both scientific consensus and ethical journalism.
4. When uncertainty exists, Agentic Newsroom clearly distinguishes between established fact, informed interpretation, and speculation.
"""

article_types = """
We publish two distinct types of stories. You must adhere to the scope and style of the assigned type:

1. Web Daily (400-700 words)
   - Focus: A single specific study, discovery, or historical event.
   - Style: Engaging and accessible, but grounded in specific research/facts.
   - Structure: 
     * Title: Catchy but accurate.
     * Lead: Hooks the reader with the core finding or dramatic moment.
     * Context: Why this matters now or how it fits into history.
     * Evidence: Specific details from the study/event (names, dates, numbers).
     * Ending: A forward-looking thought or summarizing quote.
   - Detail: Relies on 1-2 primary sources (a new study, a specific historical account).

2. Standard Feature (800-1200 words)
   - Focus: A broader trend, complex phenomenon, or narrative journey.
   - Style: Immersive, includes scene-setting, descriptive detail, and stronger narrative arc.
   - Structure: 
     * Title: Evocative and thematic.
     * Lead: Narrative or anecdotal hook (sets a scene).
     * Body: Weaves together multiple threads/studies. Uses "nut grafs" to explain significance.
     * Evidence: Richer detail, direct quotes, and multiple perspectives.
     * Ending: Returns to the opening theme ("kicker").
   - Detail: Synthesizes multiple sources, historical context, and deeper analysis.

**Lenght is especially CRITICAL for all article types**
